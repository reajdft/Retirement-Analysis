#### Projection Methodology and Cumulative Returns
* Utilizing 2019 data encompassing all 252 trading days, and 60/40 weights between SPDR ETF (ticker = SPY) and iShares aggregate bond fund (ticker = AGG) respectively, 30 year future retirement income was projected using a Monte Carlo simulation with total runs set at 500.

**SUMMARY ANALYSIS & NEXT STEPS** 
* A modest $20k initial investment at even the low end of potential outcomes puts Harold in a very comfortable position at a 4% withdrawal rate (~$95k estimated value at the 10% quartile) when compared to both his current and projected annual income (~$7.4k) 

* Projections are modelled off of a bullish 2019 and likely significantly overstate the 30 year cumulative return scenarios. Looking back a longer duration of time would be a necessary first step at assessing future returns
